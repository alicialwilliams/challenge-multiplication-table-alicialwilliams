# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Multiplication Table

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required sections are the **Project Plan** and **Reflection** below. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Project Plan

\_(Put your project plan here.
Cloned
Basic Plan

1. Create a table element in the HTML file with id mult-table.
2. Get element by id in JS file
3. for loops for the table data rows and columns and output results
4. Style the table with css

Intermediate Plan

1. Create another branch naming it devInterTable
2. Create a button element in the HTML file
3. Create input number boxes labeled columns and rows
4. RE-work the for loops to push (add) a new row and column

Advanced Plan

1. Look for resources on css hover for rows, columns and cross hair,

## Reflection

What different approaches or techniques did you consider when planning your implementation? What were the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives?

\_(Before planning I had to review nested loops in tables vs divs. I choose to work with table data because it was easier to manipulate the columns, rows, and the x-factor with conditionals. But I ran into an issue with starting the index at 0 and integrating the "x". I sought help and lead in the right direction with putting simple math in the conditional statements.

It may have been easier to set the output to an empty array as opposed to an empty string for user input boxes to manipulate rows of columns of different sizes.

I ws able to find tons of rsources on the hover color effect in css but had an issue with over shooting the top and bottom of the table. Played with the pixel size but results worse or same result. Will have to do more research.  
Upon speaking with my team members I was lead in the direction to create a class names for rows and columns in order to meet the advanced requirements. I also found a resource that lead me to hide the overflow of the column hover.)\_
